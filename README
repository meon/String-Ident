NAME
    String::Ident - clean-up string to be used as identifier and in URLs

SYNOPSIS
        my $ident = String::Ident->cleanup('Hello wœrlď!')
        is($ident,'Hello-woerld')

DESCRIPTION
    clean-up string to be used as identifier and in URLs

METHODS
  cleanup()
    "cleanup" does the following things to convert your messy string into
    something that you can use as an identifier:

        # replace unicode by ascii
        $text = unidecode($text);

        # replace anything basides numbers, letters and dash by dash
        $text =~ s/[^-A-Za-z0-9]/-/g;

        # one dash is enough
        $text =~ s/--+/-/g;

        # no need to start or end with a dash
        $text =~ s/-$//g;
        $text =~ s/^-//g;

        # maximum length
        $text = substr($text,0,30);

        # min length is set to 4 filled in by random letters

    "cleanup" per default truncates the text to 30 chars. You can pass in
    some other limit, or -1 to not truncate:

      cleanup("some very long töxt Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, ", 15);
      # 'some-very-long-toxt-'

      cleanup("some very long töxt Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, ", -1);
      # 'some-very-long-toxt-Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipiscing-elit'
