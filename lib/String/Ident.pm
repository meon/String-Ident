=head1 NAME

String::Ident - clean-up string to be used as identifier and in URLs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ident = String::Ident->cleanup('Hello wœrlď!')
    is($ident,'Hello-woerld')

=head1 DESCRIPTION

clean-up string to be used as identifier and in URLs

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cleanup()

C<cleanup> does the following things to convert your messy string into something that you can use as an identifier:

    # replace unicode by ascii
    $text = unidecode($text);

    # replace anything basides numbers, letters and dash by dash
    $text =~ s/[^-A-Za-z0-9]/-/g;

    # one dash is enough
    $text =~ s/--+/-/g;

    # no need to start or end with a dash
    $text =~ s/-$//g;
    $text =~ s/^-//g;

    # maximum length
    $text = substr($text,0,30);

    # min length is set to 4 filled in by random letters

C<cleanup> per default truncates the text to 30 chars. You can pass in some other limit, or C<-1> to not truncate:

  cleanup("some very long töxt Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, ", 15);
  # 'some-very-long-toxt-'

  cleanup("some very long töxt Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, ", -1);
  # 'some-very-long-toxt-Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipiscing-elit'
